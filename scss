so their are mainly three ways to style your app 
inline --> which has the highest priority but it mustn't not be used 
internal--> it has lower priority but it is used in react in some places for reuseability
external --> it is easy but too long to maintain it     

we uses library to style our UI like materialUI, scss, baseUI, AntUi, chakra UI
all these library gives us build-in components, easy to maintain , also 
gives consistency in our UI 

at the end of the day all these library are packages

cons of using library --> makes our bundle heavy, custom UI is hard

types of ways to style our component:
        external css
        inline
        Styled component
        library
        tailwind css framework


----------------------------------------------------------
Tailwind 
    Css on the go --> in the same file 
    flexible UI 
     

configuring our tailwind
so first is that we can use cdn link of tailwind 
EVERY THING IN TAILWIND IS CLASS , IF WE WANT TO ADD CSS TO IT, IT IS DONE ON THE
BASIS OF CLASSES

example -->    <h1 class="font-bold" > Hello World</h1>
this is the way to make our h1 bold 

tailwind is overrides our css and makes it his way of writing css 

now for building project we should install tailwind package


for writing tailwind we have a suggestion extension , it is similar to normal css just that it has 
predefined classes with css attached to it, and we are using that classes .

like class="mt-1" so it will give margin top of 4px , to give custom css like certain width we do dynamic css
syntax class ="mt-[30px]" , so it will  give the perticular css we want 

now comes the usage like when we see our css in the dom then it will give us the only css we wrote in our file,
like in production the css we wrote that perticular css will only be shipped, not the whole tailwind css package 

our parcel converts the tailwind css, and also optimize it 



cons of tailwind --> hard to read, less readability, too long line of code 


pros of tailwind --> no duplicate css, bundle time is small , more customizable,
a lot more control over the css
---------------
So to configure tailwind in parcel , These is how we can do it 

their are two ways to do it 
1. from the docs , -> 
        npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss
    .postcssrc file -> {
                        "plugins": {
                            "@tailwindcss/postcss": {}
                        }
                        }
    index.css file -> @import "tailwindcss";
    and load these css file  in the html page 


2.the way its working 
    SO these is all i installed in my dev dependecy 

    "devDependencies": {
    "@tailwindcss/cli": "^4.1.6",
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4.1.6",
    "autoprefixer": "^10.4.21",
    "parcel": "^2.15.0",
    "postcss": "^8.5.3",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.4.17"
  }
    no package installed in my dependency 
    also remember the version of these dependency as they work together nicely 
    and create the following file 

    .postcssrc file -> {
                        "plugins": {
                            "@tailwindcss/postcss": {}
                        }
                        }
    tailwind.config.js file -> 
    /** @type {import('@tailwindcss/postcss').Config} */
        module.exports = {
                                content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js,jsx}"],
                                theme: {
                                extend: {},
                                },
                                plugins: [],
                            }
  
    index.css file -> @tailwind base;
                        @tailwind components;
                        @tailwind utilities;    

    App.js file ->  import './index.css'

These may or may not work based on the device you use
