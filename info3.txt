    Machine Coding Round

This is where company ask you to build something either in pure HTML, CSS, vanilla js or the tech stack you are getting hierd  
example- todo , fetch data from api, quiz app, Nested filter, carousal 

First and formost whenever you get asked to build something in the interview like build youtube then rather than opening 
vs-code and start typing you should ask the first question which is what are the requirements 
second - features to develop 
then - tech stack 
    like with react i will use tailwind, will use redux/contextAPI for state management etc...
then spet time in planning thingd up 
    - UI design, flow , How to structure your components , Low level design
    - in simple words to discuss your apporach and to be in the same page with interviewer 

now rather than starting the project from start, intializing the project downloading the bundler, tailwind etc.. 
tell your interviewer that we will build it using create react app , that would take less time `and it would give me the 
whole app but we in the real world project we can coustomize our project like choosing our bundler and all  


So when building something , start with doing small things, for example their is a list and we have to render data of that list 
so firstly we will make it run for one list and then check does it works? and then we will use map to render
